#
# ===>> SETUP - this r-chunk does not usually need to be changed by the student.
#
# The following packages cover all of the commands that will be used in this class,
# as well as the files from the Wooldridge textbook.
# 
# For any assignment, you simply start by making a copy of this file and add the R chunks and
# text as needed below this setup chunk. 
#
# Note that these packages have been carefully selected to create a toolkit that is ideally
# suited for economic and business analysis. You might find it useful to keep this template and
# set of packages for future data analysis projects.
#
library(readr)      # for reading in .csv files
library(tidyverse)  # data wrangling
library(dplyr)      # for filter and select commands. etc.
library(wooldridge) # datasets in the textbook
library(stats)      # basic statistic commands
library(DataExplorer) # nice commands to learn about a new data set
library(stargazer)  # nice regression output
library(ggformula)  # easy graphing interface for ggplot
library(mosaic)     # accompanies ggformula
library(expss)      # apply_labels() cro()

library(lmtest)     # post-reg tests coeftest()
library(effects)    # to plot effects of one regressor, holding all others constant

# Chapter 4 - Inference

Instructions: 

- Use R to recreate the regressions and hypothesis tests in examples 4.1 - 4.9. 

- For examples 4.1 - 4.5 also use the pvalue method to evaluate the hypothesis test.

- For example 4.9, use the lht() command.


# Chapter 6 - Post-regression Analysis

Instructions: 

- Use R to recreate regressions and post-regression computations for examples 6.3, 6.5, 6.6

- Use R to recreate the regressions and answer the questions in end-of-chapter problems 6.4 and 6.10. (NOT the computer problems.)

- Use R to answer the do the computer problems C6.2, C6.9, and C6.14.
