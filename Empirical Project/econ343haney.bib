Discover how empirical researchers today actually consider and apply econometric methods with the practical approach in Wooldridge's INTRODUCTORY ECONOMETRICS: A MODERN APPROACH, 6E. Unlike traditional texts, this book uniquely demonstrates how econometrics has moved beyond a set of abstract tools to become genuinely useful for answering questions in business, policy evaluation, and forecasting. INTRODUCTORY ECONOMETRICS is organized around the type of data being analyzed with a systematic approach that only introduces assumptions as they are needed. This makes the material easier to understand and, ultimately, leads to better econometric practices. Packed with relevant applications, the text incorporates more than 100 intriguing data sets, available in six formats. Updates introduce the latest emerging developments in the field. Gain a full understanding of the impact of econometrics in practice today with the insights and applications found only in INTRODUCTORY ECONOMETRICS: A MODERN APPROACH, 6E.},
