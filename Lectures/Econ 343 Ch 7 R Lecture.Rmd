```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#
# ===>> SETUP - this r-chunk does not usually need to be changed by the student.
#
# The following packages cover all of the commands that will be used in this class,
# as well as the files from the Wooldridge textbook.
# 
# For any assignment, you simply start by making a copy of this file and add the R chunks and
# text as needed below this setup chunk. 
#
# Note that these packages have been carefully selected to create a toolkit that is ideally
# suited for economic and business analysis. You might find it useful to keep this template and
# set of packages for future data analysis projects.
#
library(readr)      # for reading in .csv files
library(tidyverse)  # data wrangling
library(dplyr)      # for filter and select commands. etc.
library(wooldridge) # datasets in the textbook
library(stats)      # basic statistic commands
library(DataExplorer) # nice commands to learn about a new data set
library(stargazer)  # nice regression output
library(ggformula)  # easy graphing interface for ggplot
library(mosaic)     # accompanies ggformula
library(expss)      # apply_labels() cro()
library(scales)     # to format inline r as currency
library(AER)        # data and commands specific to econometrics
library(car)        # for linearhypothesis tests lht(), predict() hccm() heterosced.
library(lmtest)     # post-reg tests coeftest()
library(effects)    # to plot effects of one regressor, holding all others constant
library(visualize)  # to visualize hypothesis test p-values
library(dynlm)      # lm commands for time series data
library(plm)        # lm commands for panel data

options(digits=4)   # limits number of decimals to 4 when printing
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) # TRUE = commands in r chunks to be echoed in outfile
